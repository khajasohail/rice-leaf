The dataset contains 119 jpg images of different diseases.
Here,we had tried 4 Optimizers for model creation in which Adam Optimizer shows the higher accuracy of 87.50%.Thus we can conclude that it works well for the Rice Leaf Disease Detection.
By using the Adam Optimizer we tried it with the 100 samples of test data and it showed a great output and later we tried it with image from the PC as well by using the URL.The model accurately predicted them.
Thus we can conclude that CNN model with Adam Optimizer is the best one for predicting the Rice Leaf Prediction.
