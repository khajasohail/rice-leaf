The dataset contains 119 jpg images of different diseases.
Here,we had tried 4 Optimizers for model creation in which Adam Optimizer shows the higher accuracy of 87.50%.Thus we can conclude that it works well for the Rice Leaf Disease Detection.
By using the Adam Optimizer we tried it with the 100 samples of test data and it showed a great output and later we tried it with image from the PC as well by using the URL.The model accurately predicted them.
Thus we can conclude that CNN model with Adam Optimizer is the best one for predicting the Rice Leaf Prediction.


Suggestion :-
As an Asian, Rice plays a major role in our daily diet.Thus production of healthy rice are very important as well.
Some of the suggestions from our Analysis are :-
Taking the prevention method before the disease get worse.
Awareness programs for every farmers throughout the country.
Give proper instructions,effects and prevention methods.
Provide proper pesticides,fertilizers and quality seeds by the Government can make a big change in farmers life.


Risks :-
Data Loading and processing.
High computational time.
Optimizer showing less accuracy.
Less information
